# A-Maze-Proposal

I enjoy solving maze-puzzles.  My idea is to create a maze based on choosing the right choices.  The app will be based off of making right and wrong choices.  This one might challenging because it's not the traditional maze on paper.  You will have to follow directions in order to make it through this blinding maze. 

## Stretch goal

* To have a lively interface.
